        "content": "Manchester City full-back Benjamin Mendy resumed his unofficial role as the Premier League's social media authority on own goals as Chelsea edged past Tottenham.\n\nMendy, who is yet to make his City debut due to a thigh injury, rubbed some fans and pundits up the wrong way by sarcastically hailing Lewis Dunk's \"bullet header\" when the Brighton and Hove Albion defender nodded into his own net during a 2-0 win for Pep Guardiola's side at the Amex Stadium last weekend.\n\nFormer England midfielder Steven Gerrard criticised a \"cheap shot\" from Mendy, while Frank Lampard also told BT Sport the former Monaco defender had overstepped the mark.\n\nMendy later tweeted: \"Sorry to the few people who got offended… was just banter, nothing personal.

        "teaser": "Marcos Alonso's hit an 88th-minute winner having also stunned Wembley with a brilliant free-kick in Chelsea's 2-1 win against Tottenham.",
        "content": "Chelsea got their Premier League title defence up and running amid late drama as Marcos Alonso proved to be an unlikely two-goal hero in the 2-1 win over Tottenham at Wembley.\n\nLast weekend's shock opening-day loss at home to Burnley – a match where captain Gary Cahill and Cesc Fabregas were sent off – and the ongoing saga over Diego Costa's future has cast an unwelcome shadow over Stamford Bridge and sounded unwelcome echoes of the last campaign they entered as champions.\n\nJose Mourinho paid with his job before Christmas in 2015 as a squad in turmoil hovered improbably over the relegation zone but Antonio Conte's side allayed doubts over a similar implosion as they turned in a performance of grit and togetherness at the national stadium.\n\nAlonso produced the champagne moment in the 24th minute and a remodelled defence, featuring Andreas Christensen on his first Premier League start, repelled waves of Tottenham attacks with increasing ease until a striker undid their good work.\n\nMichy Batshuayi scored decisively when Chelsea clinched the title at West Brom in May but the Belgium international headed into his own net in the 82nd minute – three minutes after coming on.\n\nIt left Alonso to step up thrillingly once more. The wing-back stormed into the Spurs box to catch out Hugo Lloris at the near post two minutes from time, leaving Conte to unfurl trademark touchline delirium.\n\n\nChelsea's injury and suspension issues meant Tiemoue Bakayoko was forced an ahead-of-schedule debut in midfield, where David Luiz was employed in a holding role.\n\nNevertheless, Conte's men started impressively and should have led in the fifth minute when Alvaro Morata wastefully headed Cesar Azpilicueta's cross wide from close range.\n\nHarry Kane forced Thibaut Courtois into an unconvincing 10th-minute save with a low, dipping drive, while Dele Alli smashed over from an acute angle when Christensen misjudged Toby Alderweireld's raking ball forward. \n\nHowever, it was Chelsea who drew first blood in the 24th minute after Alli fouled Luiz 25 yards from goal.\n\nWillian, who netted a free-kick in Chelsea's 4-2 win over Spurs on the same ground in last season's FA Cup semi-final, stood over the ball but Alonso stepped up to curl a sumptuous strike into the top corner.\n\nKane took it upon himself to drive the Spurs response – muscling past Chelsea's goalscorer to draw a block from Courtois before pulling an effort wide on the next attack before the half hour.\n\nHe went closer still in the 42nd minute when, following a driving run from Alli, he fired against the base of the post. The England striker will wonder how the anomaly of him failing to register a Premier League goal in August remains.\n\nSpurs full-back Ben Davies then had a deflected strike pushed behind, Courtois ensuring the champions' advantage remained at the interval.\n\nKane's header from an early second-half corner was blocked by Luiz and Pochettino's side peppered the Chelsea box with set pieces to no avail as the game ticked past the hour.\n\n\nWith 20 minutes to play, Willian instigated a counter-attack that ended with Morata's shot spinning wide off the prone Alderweireld.\n\nThe Brazilian impressed in a roving attacking role behind Morata and it was his turn to test the upright in the 74th minute, his low strike fizzing past Lloris' despairing dive and cannoning to safety.\n\nConte's side looked set to rue those misses when Batshuayi badly misjudged Christian Eriksen's free-kick but Alonso resoundingly answered any brewing questions over their team-spirit, meaning further Wembley heartache for Tottenham.\n\nHaving fallen in the Champions League, Europa League and FA Cup at this ground last season, victory over Burnley next weekend feels imperative for the temporary tenants.\n\n \n\nKey Opta Facts:\n\n- Spurs' 19-game home Premier League unbeaten run has come to an end, with Chelsea the first side to beat Spurs away from home since Southampton in May 2016.\n- Tottenham have lost seven of their last nine matches at Wembley (W1 D1) and lost each of their last four games against Chelsea there.\n- Harry Kane had eight shots, his most in a Premier League game without finding the net.

The wing-back stormed into the Spurs box to catch out Hugo Lloris at the near post two minutes from time, leaving Conte to unfurl trademark touchline delirium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eChelsea's injury and suspension issues meant Tiemoue Bakayoko was forced an ahead-of-schedule debut in midfield, where David Luiz was employed in a holding role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, Conte's men started impressively and should have led in the fifth minute when Alvaro Morata wastefully headed Cesar Azpilicueta's cross wide from close range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHarry Kane forced Thibaut Courtois into an unconvincing 10th-minute save with a low, dipping drive, while Dele Alli smashed over from an acute angle when Christensen misjudged Toby Alderweireld's raking ball forward. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it was Chelsea who drew first blood in the 24th minute after Alli fouled Luiz 25 yards from goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWillian, who netted a free-kick in Chelsea's 4-2 win over Spurs on the same ground in last season's FA Cup semi-final, stood over the ball but Alonso stepped up to curl a sumptuous strike into the top corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eKane took it upon himself to drive the Spurs response – muscling past Chelsea's goalscorer to draw a block from Courtois before pulling an effort wide on the next attack before the half hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe went closer still in the 42nd minute when, following a driving run from Alli, he fired against the base of the post. The England striker will wonder how the anomaly of him failing to register a Premier League goal in August remains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpurs full-back Ben Davies then had a deflected strike pushed behind, Courtois ensuring the champions' advantage remained at the interval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eKane's header from an early second-half corner was blocked by Luiz and Pochettino's side peppered the Chelsea box with set pieces to no avail as the game ticked past the hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith 20 minutes to play, Willian instigated a counter-attack that ended with Morata's shot spinning wide off the prone Alderweireld.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Brazilian impressed in a roving attacking role behind Morata and it was his turn to test the upright in the 74th minute, his low strike fizzing past Lloris' despairing dive and cannoning to safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eConte's side looked set to rue those misses when Batshuayi badly misjudged Christian Eriksen's free-kick but Alonso resoundingly answered any brewing questions over their team-spirit, meaning further Wembley heartache for Tottenham.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHaving fallen in the Champions League, Europa League and FA Cup at this ground last season, victory over Burnley next weekend feels imperative for the temporary tenants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eKey Opta Facts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e- Spurs' 19-game home Premier League unbeaten run has come to an end, with Chelsea the first side to beat Spurs away from home since Southampton in May 2016.\u003cbr /\u003e\n- Tottenham have lost seven of their last nine matches at Wembley (W1 D1) and lost each of their last four games against Chelsea there.\u003cbr /\u003e\n- Harry Kane had eight shots, his most in a Premier League game without finding the net.

Everybody knows how difficult it is to get a clean sheet in the Premier League.

We gave not a lot of clear chances away. I think it was a deserved result.\"\n\nOf Huddersfield's vocal home fans, he added: \"If we like to play our high, intense style then you need this support from the stands. They've done this today. I'm very happy for them that we were able to deliver this early home victory.\n\n\"It was a special day, a successful day as well. I think we've seen a day where both teams were very strong in defence, [well] organised.\n\n\"I think we gave more or less no clear-cut chance away. I was very happy with the performance in the defence. And then had one great moment from Aaron Mooy where we scored the winner.

And even if he is such a good technical footballer, he likes the working side of the game as well and this is why I love him.\"\n\n\nNewcastle, meanwhile, remain winless and without a point from their first two matches, having lost 2-0 at home to Tottenham last weekend.\n\nManager Rafael Benitez told the BBC: \"We are at the beginning, we have to keep going. It's the only way to improve, training harder.\"\n\nWhen it was suggested his team always faced a tough task tackling Huddersfield in the Terriers' first Premier League home game, the Spanish boss replied: \"It depends how you come.
